## PROJECT 1: Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project you will deploy a static website to AWS. 
1. First, you will `create an S3 bucket`
2. `Configure the bucket` for website hosting 
3. `Secure the bucket` using IAM policies 
4. `Upload the website files` to your bucket
5. `Speed Up content delivery` using AWS's content distribution network service, CloudFront
6. `Access your website` in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint
